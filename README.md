# Image Processing Project On Plant Disease Detection
The aim of the project is identification of the plant diseases to prevent losses in the yield and quantity of the agricultural product.
The studies of the plant diseases mean the studies of visually observable patterns seen on the plant. 
Health monitoring and disease detection on plant is very critical for sustainable agriculture.

# Here we train the datasets using the following networks-
a. VGG19

b. VGG16

c. INCEPTION RESNET V2

d. RESNET50

e. DENSENET

The network is capable of recognizing potential diseases using features in images. 
This could in turn be distributed over the world to diagnose plant diseases using a simple web application.
